## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, choosing the right framework can significantly impact the performance and scalability of your applications. Next.js has emerged as a leading choice for developers looking to leverage the power of React while ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source React framework created by Vercel that enables developers to build server-rendered React applications with ease. It simplifies the process of building complex applications by providing a robust set of features out of the box.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

One of the standout features of Next.js is its ability to render pages on the server. This means that when a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML and sends it to the client, resulting in faster load times and improved SEO.

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)

Next.js also supports static site generation, allowing developers to pre-render pages at build time. This is particularly useful for content-heavy sites where performance is critical.

### 3. API Routes

With Next.js, you can create API endpoints directly within your application. This feature allows for seamless integration of backend functionality without the need for a separate server.

### 4. Automatic Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller bundles, ensuring that users only download the necessary code for the page they are visiting. This leads to faster load times and a better user experience.

### 5. Built-in CSS and Sass Support

Next.js comes with built-in support for CSS and Sass, allowing developers to style their applications without additional configuration.

## Getting Started

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new project using the following command:

## Deployment
1. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Deploy to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js (LTS version recommended).
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Routing
### Basic Routing
Each file in the `pages/` directory becomes a route:
```javascript
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```
Access at `/about`.

### Dynamic Routing
Use square brackets for dynamic routes:
```javascript
// pages/post/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Post() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <h1>Post ID: {id}</h1>;
}
```
Access at `/post/123`.

## Data Fetching
### getStaticProps
Fetch data at build time:
```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return { props: { message: 'Hello World' } };
}

export default function Home({ message }) {
  return <h1>{message}</h1>;
}
```

### getServerSideProps
Fetch data on each request:
```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return { props: { message: 'Hello from Server' } };
}

export default function Home({ message }) {
  return <h1>{message}</h1>;
}
```

---

## API Routes
Create backend endpoints in the `pages/api` directory:
```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello API' });
}
```
Access at `/api/hello`.


```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
